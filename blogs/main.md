# About me
### My name is Jesse Taube, I'm 18 and graduated High School on January 18.

I'm a tech enthusiast and aspiring embedded engineer.

I have many servers do networking and other computational tasks, I also host a 10Gbe NAS on it as well as many websites. My servers run with Debian, Cockpit and KVM.
I also have a Cisco router and switch that I am learning Cisco's cli on.

I am knowledgeable in C and C++ I also know a bit of Python, Java, Swift and Bash(does that count).
I like making different embedded projects I started learning with Arduino when I was 8,
but I quickly learned how other MCUs worked. My favorite MCUs are probably the Attiny series.
Recently I have been looking into embedded Linux and FreeRTOS.
