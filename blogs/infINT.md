# infINT:

In this project I wanted to improve my skills in math and C++.
I wanted to make a prime number finding program that uses AVX and AVX512 functions.
I decided this after seeing how slow the original InfInt project was and I wanted to see how much I could do on my own. Unfortunately is is not finished I still want be able to allocate as much memory as I possible and also implement a faster multiply and divide function using FFT. Sense making this project I see now that I probably cant make something as fast as GMP, but was one of my favorite C++ projects because I rarely had to search anything about APIâ€™s as it was almost all pure math.
