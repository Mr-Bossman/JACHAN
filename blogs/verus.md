# Verus Coin:
I like this CPU mineable crypto currency called Verus.
They have mashed together many cool ideas and created some of their own, their community is very nice and I support them as the community makes the project go forward. Sense it is cpu minable i made 2 apps on for IOS and one for android that allows me to mine on phones the one for IOS isn't done but it was an interesting experience with clang  and the darwin kennel i had to work on my swift and java skills. I had previously learned in school and from making Minecraft mods. In the end I made some very interesting proof of concept apps that are only kind of useful.
