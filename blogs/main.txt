# About me
### My name is Jesse Taube, im 18 in currently in high school.

I'm a tech enthusiast and aspiring embedded engineer.

I have many servers that I do networking and other things on, I also host a 10Gbe NAS on it as well as a websites. I run my servers with debian cockpit and kvm.
I also have a cisco router and switch that I am learning cisco cli on.

I like coding. I am knowledgeable in C and C++ i know a little python, java, swift and bash(does that count).
I like making different embedded projects i started learning with arduino when i was 8,
but I quickly learned how other MCUs worked. My favorite MCUs are probably the attiny series.
Recently I have been looking into embedded Linux and FreeRTOS.
