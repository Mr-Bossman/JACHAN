# ColorCat

I got inspired by a program called [LolCat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat) that does a similar thing.
Unfortunalty I don't like ruby so I decided to re make it in GNU-style C.
I did this project mainly to get more experiance in GNU-style C.
ColorCat allows users to create colored text in a variety of different ANSI colors.
This can is an amazing program for adding visual appeal to your terminal.
The program is easy to use and emulates Lolcats behavior.
If you're looking to add a splash of color to a boring terminal with bold, vibrant text,
ColorCat has got you covered.
