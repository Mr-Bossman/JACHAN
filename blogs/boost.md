# Boost:
In this project, I wanted to make a high-efficiency boost converter for another project.
I first had to make an adjustable frequency and duty cycle from an MCU so I went with the Attiny406 I had on hand I then spend a couple of days making a serial console for the frequency generator (timer) in the MCU so I could do some tests. I made a couple of scripts to graph the frequency and duty cycle compared to efficiency ( in this case voltage with a constant load) although, the graphs seemed all over the place.  If the magnetic flux of the inductor is held at its max for too long it will lose power in the form of heat, but if I hold it too short I won't have enough power stored to keep a stable voltage. So my theory was if I charge it to the 99% of the magnetic flux it should be the most efficient right? Well, I was partially right when I changed the graph to charge time the max efficiency’s clustered around a time of ⅓ or e^-1 (within a margin of error ) so now I knew if I kept the charge time to about the solution to: (3 (1 - e^(-(x R)/L)) - 1)/R = 0 I should get the best efficiency. So I did that I coded it up in C and made a boost converted out of it. Unfortunately, the MCU isn't fast enough to get the max efficiency for small inductors in the 10’s of micro Henrys but it gets better as u go to the Millihenry. I could only get about 50 volts from my boost converter so I just added a 6-stage voltage doubler to the output and made an adjustable Vin-500V boost converter.
