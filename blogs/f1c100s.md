# F1C100s:

One day I was browsing Reddit and saw Linux on a business card. I was intrigued. So I decided to make it have a display output and run debian on it. I did succeed on both. I first started figuring out how u-boot and the Linux kernel worked. I then got a lichee pi nano from Speeed. And got Linux working on it. Once it got it working I wanted to make my own board so that I could get easy access to the pins that control display output. I then created a program to control an 8080 interface display I got from Alibaba. I wanted to get Debian running on it so I started to learn about Debootstrap and making a custom Debian Distro. I managed to get it to work after a while, but the display was small and USB and audio still didn't work. So I found some patches for audio and usb and added them to the kernel. I also then realized I was doing Debootstrap slightly wrong so I fixed that. But the display was still too small. So I made an RGB interface to VGA adapter circuit after realizing the similarity to VGA and looking around if others had done it. At that point, I thought I was done with the project.
