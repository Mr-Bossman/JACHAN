# Reviving a lost meme
## My journey remaking leekspin.com

After flash died RIP 1997-2020 the little known website [leekspin.com](https://leekspin.com) was no more.
It was the inspiration for the song Ievan Polkka by Otomania, voiced by [Hatsune Miku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku).
Although the original image was Orihime from [Bleach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_(TV_series)) many people associate the song with Miku.
For many weeks in the summer of 2020 I sat wondering if the creator knew or even cared about the website any more. One of those days I decided to make my own version of the website, so I went and rented the domain [leekspin.co](https://leekspin.co) made a simple JS counter and hosted it on github pages. I then added it to google's search indexer and waited. Soon people asked for a global leader-board so I went ahead and moved the site to my servers and added a simple way to track the page time. Soon after people asked me if I could change the image and song, I have added the ability to change images but as of writing only has one version of the song.
