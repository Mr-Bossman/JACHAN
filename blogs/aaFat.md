# aaFAT
### Absolutely awful FAT

aaFAT is a filesystem that I designed to work on embedded application in eeprom. I decided i wanted to make my own filesystem after staring work an a hardware wallet for verus coin. I went looking around on the web for file systems that may work but i didnt like any of them, so i decided i wanted to make my own.
